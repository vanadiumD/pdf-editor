I prefer using the OneNote app for my homework and notes, but converting them into a printable PDF format can be troublesome. OneNote PDFs are often in long-page format, making it time-consuming to cut them into A4 pages, and some PDF editors like Foxit can be frustrating to work with for long-height page.
